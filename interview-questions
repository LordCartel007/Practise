1. Tell me about yourself.
   ðŸ§  Tip: Summarize your background, highlight skills, and focus on your dev journey.

âœ… Answer:

Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with a strong focus on React and Express. I started with HTML/CSS and quickly moved into building full CRUD apps using the MERN stack. I enjoy solving real problems with code, and recently built a dashboard with login/auth and data filtering. Iâ€™m always improving through projects and daily coding practice.

2. What are your strengths?
   ðŸ§  Tip: Mention real skills (technical and soft).

âœ… Answer:

Iâ€™m good at breaking down problems into steps, especially in React. Iâ€™m also a fast learner and not afraid to ask questions or use resources when stuck. I stay calm under pressure and enjoy building features that work smoothly for users.

3. What is your biggest weakness?
   ðŸ§  Tip: Be honest, but show youâ€™re working on it.

âœ… Answer:

I used to rely too much on Google even for things Iâ€™ve written before. So now, Iâ€™m practicing more coding from memory and doing daily drills to reduce that dependence and increase my confidence during interviews.

4. Why should we hire you?
   ðŸ§  Tip: Show what value you bring.

âœ… Answer:

I can take a real-world idea and turn it into a working web app using React and Node. I work well with teams, I care about writing clean, maintainable code, and I can deliver fast â€” whether from scratch or maintaining existing codebases.

5. Where do you see yourself in 2â€“3 years?
   âœ… Answer:

I see myself becoming a strong fullstack developer who can lead small teams, mentor junior devs, and handle backend logic just as well as frontend UI. I also want to contribute to open source and maybe build tools that other devs use.

6. Tell us about a project you're proud of.
   âœ… Answer:

I built a React dashboard with login, user roles, and a product filter system using MongoDB. It helped me understand API design and how to manage UI state properly. The project taught me a lot about combining frontend and backend logic.

7. How do you handle pressure or deadlines?
   âœ… Answer:

I break the task into smaller parts, set short-term goals, and communicate clearly if anything blocks me. I avoid panicking by focusing on progress. Tools like Trello and Notion help me stay organized and on track.

8. Do you prefer working alone or in a team?
   âœ… Answer:

Both. I enjoy writing code alone to stay focused, but I also love working in a team â€” discussing ideas, learning from others, and reviewing each other's code. Collaboration leads to better results.

9. How do you keep your skills updated?
   âœ… Answer:

I code daily, follow tech content on Twitter/YouTube, read docs, and try to build something new every month â€” even small projects. I also solve coding challenges and stay active on GitHub.

10. Do you have any questions for us? (Always say yes!)
    âœ… Sample Questions to Ask Them:

What does the development process look like in your team?

What stack will I be working with most?

Are there opportunities for mentorship or skill growth?
