What are props in React?
Short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù, they are read-only data passed from parent to child components.

What is state in React?
A built-in object for holding dynamic data within a component.

What is the difference between state and props?
Props are immutable and passed externally; state is mutable and maintained internally.

Stopped Here üëçüëçüëç

How does React update the UI?
By comparing the virtual DOM with the previous one and updating only the changed parts.

What is a key in React lists?
A unique identifier used to help React identify which items have changed.

Why should keys be unique?
To optimize rendering and avoid unwanted re-renders.

What are fragments in React?
A way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
